# Hangman

In the project were used XML files to quickly access words by index. Download the pugixml library I used from its official website: https://pugixml.org/. Extract zip file 
near src directory. Compile your program using _g++ src/main.cpp -o src/main_
 in hangman directory. Run using _./src/main_.
